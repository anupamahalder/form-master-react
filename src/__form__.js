/*
    We can do work with form with multiple ways

    1. use form tag and onSubmit handler with event (e) from e access e.target.[name of the input field].value

    2. controlled element: use individual field state
    
    3. controlled element: one object in a state holding all the input fields value

    4. uncontrolled element: useRef to create a reference to the element and access value by using like: nameRef.current.value
